# ReactCalculatorApp

# Description: "This is a React-based Arithmetic Calculator App that performs and displays the results of basic mathematical operations using modular JavaScript functions. The app showcases four fundamental arithmetic operations — addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division — implemented in a separate module (calculator.js). These functions are imported into the main file (index.js) and their results are rendered inside an unordered list (<ul>) using React."
